# Personal Portfolio Project

This is the first version of my personal portfolio website project. Within the javascript file contains an array of objects that adds project information for the 'Projects' section of the site.

I have yet to include the final images and content for the site, but the design and layout are all ready to go.

I've enjoyed experimenting with bootstrap and jquery. The first jquery function I included was the click to scroll function from the navigation bar to sections within the page.

Future features to add:
- Favicon
- A hamburger menu for mobile.
- URLs that change when a section is scrolled upon.
